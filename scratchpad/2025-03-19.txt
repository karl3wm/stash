I'm running into an issue where a python loop over integers calling gcd() appears to execute faster than a numpy modulo operation over a vector of the same data.

I'm making a folder here with a test python file in it to troubleshoot.

The test did not reproduce the issue. I'll need to bisect from the original code to see what stimulates it. Nice to see numpy behaving fast again.

I'm actually getting quite different numbers. I'd better track these things.

	0000-test.py test file, does not appear to replicate behavior. math_gcd = 0.1154  numpy_mod = 0.00646
	0001.py code demonstrating issue, unisolated.                  math_gcd = 1.92e-6 igcd = 0.00498
	observing now that an editing mistake is in the file: I meant to return prior to the `if` block, short-circuiting it. i was not testing what i thought i was.
	maybe i made the change and forgot to save the file before running it.
	0002.py readded the short circuit. still demonstrates issue.   math_gcd = 1.48e-6 igcd = 0.004177
	0003.py removed extra things from 0002.py, changed names.      math_gcd = 1.61e-6 numpy_mod = 0.00617
