I'm running into an issue where a python loop over integers calling gcd() appears to execute faster than a numpy modulo operation over a vector of the same data.

I'm making a folder here with a test python file in it to troubleshoot.

The test did not reproduce the issue. I'll need to bisect from the original code.
