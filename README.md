# stash

Given my ongoing situation with engineered DID, I can spontaneously lose
everything out of nowhere and have developed a habit of frequently saving to
somewhere remote.

If I don't do this, I lose my work. It's not the only thing I need to navigate
to accomplish something, but it's a baseline.

This repository is intended to store various other work stored in branches. I
may also store crazed-sounding ramblings here.
